  <ol>
    <li>Annotations are transferred between systems,</li>
    <li>Notifications of events within the annotation ecosystem are described and transfered between systems, and</li>
    <li>Relevant annotations are discovered through queries on hosting systems.</li>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Web Annotation Protocol describes a series of transport mechanisms for creating, managing, retrieving and searching for annotations, as well as notifying systems of these events. [...bla bla bla...] Annotations in this specification follow the data model, vocabulary and serialization requirements of the Web Annotation Data Model.
</p>

<p>The specification makes extensive use of the Linked Data Platform and ActivityStreams specifications. [...bla bla bla...]</p>

<section>
	<h3>Aims of the Protocol</h3>

	<p>
The primary aim of the Web Annotation Protocol is to provide a standard set of interactions that will allow annotation clients and servers to interoperate seamlessly, when both sides implement the specification. [...]

</p>

<section>
<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [[rfc2119]].

<section>
<h2>Web Annotation Protocol Principles</h2>

<p>
The Web Annotation Protocol is defined using the following basic principles:

<ul>

<li>The protocol is developed within the framework laid out by the Web Architecture</li>
<li>Interactions will follow the REST best practice guidelines when there is a resource being acted upon.</li>
<li>Interactions are designed to take place over HTTP, but the design should not prevent implementations that carry the transactions over other protocols</li>
<li>Existing specifications and systems will be re-used whenever possible, constrained further when necessary, with invention of new specifications only as a last resort</li>
<li>Simplicity and ease of implementation are important design criteria, but ultimately subjective and less important than the above principles.</li> 
</ul>
</p>


</section>


<section>
	<h2>Annotation Protocol</h2>

<section>

  <h3>LDP Containers</h3>

<p>Annotations are managed within Containers.  A Container has a URI which provides the service endpoint at which Annotations may be created and from which the list of managed Annotations may be retrieved.  The Annotations will be assigned URIs with an additional path component below the Container's URI.</p>

<section>
  <h3>Containers for Annotations</h3>

<p>A conforming server MUST provide one or more LDP Containers within which Annotations may be managed. The RECOMMENDED URI path for at least one such container is <code>/annotations/</code> but any URI MAY be used. Container URIs MUST end in a <code>"/"</code> character.</p>

<p>The server MUST support the following HTTP methods on the Container's URI: <code>POST</code> (create a new Annotation, described in 3.2.1), <code>GET</code> (retrieve the description of the Container and the list of its contents, described below), and <code>OPTIONS</code> (enable CORS pre-flight requests).   The server SHOULD support the HTTP <code>HEAD</code> method on the Container's URI.  All supported methods MUST be advertised in the <code>Allow</code> header of all responses.</p>

<p>An Annotation Container MUST advertise its type using a <code>Link</code> header.  The URI in the header MUST be <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#BasicContainer</code> with the <code>rel</code> attribute value of <code>type</code>.  The type MUST also be present in the description of the Container.</p>

<p>The server MUST support a JSON-LD description of the container, which MUST include its URI, type, and a list of the Annotation URIs that it contains.  It MAY also include other information such as a title or label, description, or link to acceptable usage terms.  The URIs of the contained Annotations MAY be complete, or relative to the container.</p>

<p class="note">Can/should we make use of .well-known/ for (further) discovery? [rfc5785] And/or a site-maps extension? </p>

<div>
<p>For an Annotation Container that contains four Annotations, an example GET request and response with relative Annotation URIs might look like:</p>

Request:
<pre class="example">
GET /annotations/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Accept: application/ld+json
</pre>
Response:
<pre class="example">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/ld+json
ETag: "_87e52ce123123"
Link: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#BasicContainer&gt;; rel="type"
Allow: POST,GET,OPTIONS,HEAD
Content-Length: 221

  "@type": "ldp:BasicContainer",
  "title": "A Container for Open Annotations",
  "contains": ["anno1","anno2","anno3","anno4"] 
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>Any resource MAY link to an Annotation Container when Annotations on the resource SHOULD be created within the referenced Container.  This link is carried in an HTTP <code>Link</code> header and the <code>rel</code> attribute MUST be <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#annotation-service</code>.</p>

<div>
<p>For an example image resource, a GET request and response with a link to the above Annotation Container might look like:</p>

Request:
<pre class="example">
GET /images/logo.jpg HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
</pre>
Response:
<pre class="example">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: image/jpeg
Link: &lt;http://example.org/annotations/&gt;; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#annotation-service"
Allow: GET
Content-Length: 76983

[...]
</pre>
</div>


</section>

<section>
  <h3>Containers for Related Resources</h3>

<p>Annotations may have related resources that are required for their correct interpretation and rendering, such as content resources used in the role of the Body, CSS stylesheets for the rendering of the annotation, SVG documents describing a non-rectangular region, amongst other resources.  These resources must be able to be stored in conjunction with the Annotation.</p>

<p>Upon the creation of a new Annotation resource, a server MUST create two new containers below the Annotation's URI path:
  <ol>
    <li>A Direct Container for managing body resources</li>
    <li>A Basic Container for managing other resources</li>
  </ol>
<p>

<p>These Containers MUST support the same verbs as the Annotation Container, and MUST support identifying their type with a <code>Link</code> header.</p>

<p>The Direct Container for body resources MUST have the URI path segment of "body" and end with a "/".  Thus if the newly created annotation has the URI <code>http://example.org/annotations/anno1</code>, then the Container's URI will be <code>http://example.org/annotations/anno1/body/</code>.</p>

<p>The Container's membership resource MUST be the Annotation, and the member relation MUST be <code>oa:hasBody</code>. In practice, this means that when a new resource is created within the Container, it is added as a body to the referenced Annotation.</p>

<div>
<p>An example request an response for a Direct Container that contains a single image file for the first example Annotation's body:</p>

Request:
<pre class="example">
GET /annotations/anno1/body/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Accept: application/ld+json
</pre>
Response:
<pre class="example">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/ld+json
ETag: "_87e52ce124124"
Link: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#DirectContainer&gt;; rel="type"
Allow: POST,GET,OPTIONS,HEAD
Content-Length: 342

{
  "@context": [
    "http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp",
    "http://www.w3.org/ns/oa"],
  "@id": "http://example.org/annotations/anno1/body/",
  "@type": "ldp:DirectContainer",
  "title": "A Container for Bodies of anno1",
  "membershipResource": "http://example.org/annotations/anno1",
  "hasMemberRelation": "body",
  "contains": ["body1.jpg"] 
}
</pre>
</div>


<p>The Basic Container for other resources MUST have the URI path segment of "other". Thus if the newly created annotation has the URI <code>http://example.org/annotations/anno1</code>, then the Container's URI will be <code>http://example.org/annotations/anno1/other/</code>.</p>

<p>Unlike the Body container, which automatically adds the link to the Annotation, this Container does not create additional links within the Annotation.  As the Annotation must be created first for the container to be generated, the Annotation MUST therefore be updated (see Section 3.2.2) after the new resource's URI has been assigned so that the link can be made in the appropriate place.</p>

<div>

<p>An example request and response for the Basic Container associated with the first example Annotation:</p>

Request:
<pre class="example">

<section>
  <h3>Creation, Updating and Deletion of Resources</h3>

<section>
<h3>Create a New Annotation</h3>

<p>New Annotations are created by posting the JSON-LD serialization to an Annotation Container.  The Annotation's data is sent in the body of the request. All of the known information about the Annotation SHOULD be sent, and if there are already URIs associated with the resources, they MAY be included.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of an Annotation, the server MAY assign HTTP URIs to blank nodes in the Annotation, and MUST assign a URI to the Annotation resource, even if it aleady has one.  If blank nodes are so identified, then if the resource's URI is requested, then the server MUST respond appropriately according to this specification.</p>

<p>The server SHOULD also add additional information to the Annotation if known. Possible additional information includes the agent that created it, the time of the Annotation's creation, additional types and formats.</p>

<p>The server MUST respond with a <code>201</code> Created response if the creation is successful, and an appropriate error code otherwise.  The response MUST have a <code>Location</code> header with the Annotation's new URI.</p>

<p>The body of the response SHOULD be the Annotation as stored by the server, including any additional URIs or triples created in the process, and if so barring additional Content Negotiation, it MUST be in JSON-LD following the serialization in the Annotation Data Model specification.</p>

<h3>Update an Existing Annotation</h3>

<p>Annotations, once created may be updated in two different ways:
<ol>
  <li>Using an HTTP PUT request to replace the entire state of the Annotation.</li>
  <li>Using an HTTP PATCH request to provide only the differences between the current state and the new state.</li>
</ol>

</p>

<section>
<h3>Update with Complete Annotation State</h3>

<p>Replacing the Annotation with a new state is done with the HTTP PUT method, where the entity-body of the request is the complete state of the Annotation.  The client SHOULD use the <code>If-Match</code> header with a value of the ETag it received from the server before the editing process began, to avoid collisions of multiple users editing the same document at the same time.</p>

<p>If successful, the server MUST return a 200 OK status with the Annotation as the body according to the content-type requested.</p>

<p>Servers MUST advertise the availability of updating via PUT on requests to the Annotation's URI using the Allow response header.</p>

<div>

<section>
<h3>Update with Differences between States</h3>

<p>Updating an Annotation with just the changes needed uses the LD Patch specification.  The entity-body of the request is the LD Patch document, which specifies statements to add and delete.  The server responds with the Annotation after it has applied the PATCH.</p>

<div>

<section>
<h3>Delete an Existing Annotation</h3>

<p>Clients use the HTTP DELETE method to request that an Annotation be deleted.  Clients SHOULD send the ETag of the Annotation in the <code>If-Match</code> header to ensure that it is operating against the most recent version of the Annotation.</p>

<p>If the DELETE request is successfully processed, then the server MUST return a 200 or 204 status response.  When an Annotation is deleted, the subsidiary containers for bodies and other resources MUST also be deleted.  The URIs of deleted Annotations SHOULD NOT be re-used for subsequent Annotations.</p> 

<div>
Request:
<pre class="example">
DELETE /annotations/anno1 HTTP/1.1

<section>

  <h3>Create, Update and Delete Related Resources</h3>

<p>
The creation and deletion methods for resources in the body and other resource containers are the same as above, but with the entity body being the representation of the resource to be created.  For updating, only the complete replacement approach is supported via the <code>PUT</code> method.  The server MAY support <code>PATCH</code> requests, but no implementation requirements are specified.</p>


</section>

<section>
<h3>Suggest the URI for a Resource</h3>
<p>The URI path segment that is appended to the Container URI for a resource may be suggested by a client using the <code>Slug</code> HTTP header when the resource is created.  The server MAY use this name, so long as it does not already identify an existing resource, but MAY ignore it and use an automatically assigned name. </p>

<p>The same approach is used in all creation requests for annotations, bodies or other resources.</p>

  <h3>Retrieve a Known Annotation</h3>

<p>Clients may retrieve an Annotation from its advertised URI with the HTTP <code>GET</code> method.  Servers MUST support the JSON-LD representation using the Open Annotation context, and MAY support other rdf serializations or JSON-LD contexts.</p>

  <h3>List Annotations</h3>

<p>In order to retrieve the list of annotations within a Container, a client can dereference the Container's URI.  The Annotations' URIs will be in the <code>contains</code> list, as per example 2.</p>

</section>

<section>

  <h3>Search for Annotations</h3>

<p class="note">TBD</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h3>Retrieval of Related Resources</h3>

<p>The representation of the related resource MUST be available at the URI advertised from the Annotation document.  For example, if the Annotation references a body resource at <code>http://example.org/annotations/anno1/body/body1.jpg</code> then a <code>GET</code> request on that URI MUST return the jpeg image.  Additional metadata may be available within the system for inclusion in the Annotation's document, but if available separately, it must be at a different URI.  Discovery of that URI is not in scope of this specification.</p>
